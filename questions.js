        passage:
            `For many years, economists assumed that improvements in transportation would inevitably reduce regional differences in 
            prices. Better transportation, after all, allows goods to move more cheaply between markets. Recent studies, however, suggest 
            a more complicated pattern. Reduced transportation costs may encourage regions to specialize in different industries. Such 
            specialization can increase differences in wages and land prices even while the prices of traded goods become more uniform.`,

        passage:
            `Early studies of urban tree planting emphasized its aesthetic benefits. Trees, researchers argued, improved the visual character of 
            densely built neighborhoods and therefore contributed indirectly to residents' well-being. More recent research has broadened this view by 
            examining measurable environmental effects. Urban trees can reduce surface temperatures by providing shade and can absorb some airborne pollutants.

Nevertheless, enthusiasm for large-scale planting programs has occasionally exceeded the evidence supporting them. The cooling effects of trees vary 
substantially according to species, climate, soil conditions, and the spatial arrangement of vegetation. Moreover, trees themselves require water and 
maintenance, resources that may be scarce in some cities.

These qualifications do not imply that urban planting programs are misguided. Rather, they suggest that policymakers should resist treating tree coverage 
as a universal solution. A program appropriate for a humid city with abundant rainfall may be poorly suited to an arid city facing severe water shortages. 
The relevant question, therefore, is not simply whether cities should plant more trees, but where, what kind, and under what environmental conditions.`,
